## Notes

### What I find good in the mock-up
The design look great !
A lot of call to action to bring a great user experience with the customer, the fact that we can see the card with our name. The color contrast, the thread with dashes, the icons library are really cool. I like shadows and blue color palette with the green and yellow bringing contrast.

### What could be improved in the mock-up
I know this is just an exercice but there are some sections it's difficult to understand what it's talking about.
Some buttons (example in the awesome project panel) I'm not sur where it is linked: is it a video modal, another page ?

Buttons padding are too different, there are some very small, other less small, some bigger, some outlined, some underlined.
Social media icons in the footer are not regular, 2 of them are outlined, and others are filled.

In the awards section, the fact there is a box on the side of the mockup is confusing, I'm not sure if this section is static or it's a carousel ?

Well Thank you for this exercice, it was fun ! :)
